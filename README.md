This project analyzes food waste in the United States, focusing on its sources, reasons for waste, environmental impacts, and potential solutions. By understanding the magnitude and origins of food waste, this analysis aims to inform policy and programs that tackle food insecurity and reduce waste.

## INTRODUCTION 
Food waste remains a critical issue in the United States, posing significant economic, environmental, and social challenges. Every year, approximately 30-40% of the U.S. food supply goes uneaten, amounting to over $378 billion in economic losses and profound environmental consequences. This not only represents a substantial waste of resources but also exacerbates food insecurity among millions of Americans.

## KEY QUESTIONS
In order to uncover the root causes of food waste some key questions are outlined below to be answered by the data analysis.

1. Magnitude of Food Waste: How much food is wasted annually in the U.S.?
2. Sources of Waste: What are the major contributors to food waste at the national and state levels?
3. Reasons for Waste: Why is surplus food wasted?
4. Disposal Methods: Where does the waste primarily go?
5. Environmental Impact: What are the environmental consequences of food waste?


## DATA PREPARATION AND PROCESSING

The primary data sources for this project include 3 CSV files sourced from REFED.ORG:

REFED_US_FOOD_SURPLUS_SUMMARY: National food surplus data.
REFED_US_STATE_FOOD_SURPLUS_SUMMARY: State-level food surplus data.
REFED_US_FOOD_SURPLUS_CAUSE_SUMMARY: Data on the causes of food surplus in the U.S.

After merging, some data cleaning steps were applied to the tables in Tableau to prepare the data for analysis.

## DATA ANALYSIS SUMMARY


# 1.  Waste Quantity

Approximately 87% of surplus food in the U.S. goes to waste, translating to $378 billion a year spent on food that is never eaten.

# 2.  Waste Sources 

Over 80% of all food waste originates from consumer-facing businesses and homes.

# 3.  Waste Causes

Food loss begins at the production level when farmers do not harvest all that they produce. In the manufacturing industries, products can require trimming for use in end products, leading to edible parts going unused (e.g. ends and skins). Furthermore, high customer standards for freshness lead food businesses to dispose of safe, edible food when it is perceived to be past its prime. Lastly, the demand for variety and abundance of food creates waste in consumer homes.

# 4.  Waste Destinations

80% of food waste derived from consumer-facing businesses and consumers are channeled to landfills thereby contributing to pollution.

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This analysis highlights the urgent need for integrated strategies to reduce food waste in the U.S. Effective measures could significantly mitigate environmental impacts and enhance food security. Such measures include:

 - Prevention and Reduction: Implementing sustainable farming practices and improving the food supply chains.
 - Recovery and Redistribution: Establishing food collection networks and incentivizing food donations.
 - Recycling and Composting: Promoting community composting programs and biogas production facilities.
